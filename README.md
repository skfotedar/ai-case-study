# Overview of Kinaxis and Artificial Intelligence in Supply Chain Management
## Overview and Origin
In this report, I delve into [Kinaxis](https://www.kinaxis.com/en), a supply chain planning software company headquartered in Ottawa, Canada. My interest in Kinaxis was piqued when the company I work with started using its software package, [RapidResponse](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/resources/content/kinaxis-difference/kinaxis-rapidrespons). As I explored the tool on the company's website, I discovered their current initiatives in [Artifical Intelligence (AI)](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/ai-supply-chain). This not only sparked my curiosity but also underscored the significant role of AI in revolutionizing operations management and supply chain.

Kinaxis was founded in 1984 by [Duncan Klett](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/blog/author/klett) as [Cadence Computer Corporation](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/about) and was originally a supply-chain analysis company. Today, Kinaxis has 1,000 employees and over 100 customers and is on pace to reach [$500M of revenue in 2024](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/kinaxis-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results). [The company was privately held until 2000 and went public in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinaxis). Their flagship product is RapidResponse (RR), a visual supply chain planning software package atop ERP systems. I use it as my role to generate reports, view status, and run 'what-if' scenarios. 

Kinaxis competes with several large, established software companies ([IBM, SAP, Oracle, Blue Yonder, ONE Network]((https://www.g2.com/products/kinaxis/competitors/alternatives))) and some upstarts like [o9 Solutions](https://o9solutions.com/solutions/ai-ml-forecasting?utm_campaign=US_en_Brand&utm_medium=google-ad&utm_source=marketing&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwn7mwBhCiARIsAGoxjaKrlYxC_n9eE6uR38c8FpAZRmDwYD8MMbOuvbTXDyzkZuSATVF2k4kaApf4EALw_wcB) and [Anaplan](https://www.anaplan.com/).

## Business Activities
Kinaxis is a hybrid product and professional services company. They sell RR and then provide consulting services to help customers optimize the tool to improve their supply chain operations. They have an impressive list of customers; [Lenovo](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/news/press-releases/2019/kinaxis-closes-deal-lenovo-improve-customer-experience), [Merck](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/resources/content/lifesciences/merck-k20?utm_source=website&utm_medium=osr&utm_campaign=7015Y000003LWFH&_gl=1*a5gm1l*_ga*MTIyNzY2NjE5OC4xNzEyMDgwMDUx*_ga_0VRJH9V89N*MTcxMjI2NjM2NS41LjEuMTcxMjI2NzMyMS41OS4wLjA.), [AMD](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/news/press-releases/2017/amd-selects-kinaxis-rapidresponse-revolutionize-its-supply-chain-planning), and [Ford](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/blog/video-ford-motor-company-creating-global-data-standards-scm-software) to name a few. They also have partnership with other [professional services companies](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2017/bain-establishes-partnership-with-kinaxis/) who can use RR in their customer engagments in exchange for a licesing fee. 

Kinaxis has been able to carve a niche in the ERP landscape by providing a solution that appeals to large companies with large and complex operations. That and an intuitive easy to use interface set it apart from its competitors. The tool is not recommended for smaller organizations as the cost and training requirements are not worth the benefit.

RR is built on a range of different technologies - [Java, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Bootstrap](https://stackshare.io/kinaxis/kinaxis#stack) to name a few.

In regards to their activities in AI, their website has content around what they call, ["Orchestration"](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/solutions). Their vision is to have a software digital twin of a company's supply chain where clients can view the current state of the supply chain along with impact that any range of scenarios would have across a broad number of finacial and supply chain metrics. The vision is impressive and AI would most certainly drive much of this, but I got the impression that this more of an aspiration at this time.

## Landscape
Supply Chain Management is a highly data-driven, analytic field well suited for AI applications. A recent poll of an [MIT audience]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSEAVsbSTIM)) stated that three areas are ripe to be impacted by AI.

>1/ [Demand Forecasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSEAVsbSTIM?t=870): Companies have plenty of data, but they still rely on the hidden factory and industry knowledge of experienced demand planners to ask questions. When a forecast is presented, AI could provide questions already in place and potential recommendations to iterate on.

>2/ [Inventory Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSEAVsbSTIM?t=1120): Companies always balance the amount of inventory they should keep on hand with customer commitments. They always ask deep questionsâ€”how much to carry, where to store, what supplier options, geographies, and what are the quality and delivery metrics. There are models in place now, but they can be improved.

>3/ [Supply Chain Chat Bots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSEAVsbSTIM?t=1500): One of the most common, non-value-added activities in a manufacturing company is the constant questions about when parts will arrive or ship. Customers will ping their vendors, and executives will ask when shipments arrive at the site or the customer. This often involves endless emails, IMs, and digging to discover what is happening. It would be nice to have a chatbot where a user could ask, "When is part number 12345 due to leave the Phoenix plant?" and the chatbot would reply with an answer.

Beyond the three areas listed above, I envision these other areas as supply chain functions that AI can aid.

>1/ Quality: [First Pass Yield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-pass_yield) - the rate that a manufacturer produces a part to the quality specification without failures - is one of the most important metrics in manufacturing. Sensors could be deployed to monitor the manufacturing of parts, and the data could be fed into an Machine Learning (ML) engine to identify potential risks and failures before the end of the line. 

>Another area where AI can be used in Quality is documentation and training. Organizations have Quality Management Systems [(QMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management_system) that comprise a vast trove of documents that can be quite labor-intensive to maintain. A standard failure mode is when a quality escape takes place, a mitigation step is put in place but not formally documented in the QMS, or it is documented but then not updated in the employee training materials. AI can make this activity more accessible and less bureaucratic.

>2/ Process Improvement: Companies rely on Lean manufacturing principles to continuously improve their facilities. One tool used in this is a [Kaizen](https://www.ascm.org/ascm-insights/understanding-kaizen-events/) event. A Kaizen event usually lasts several days, during which a team gathers to brainstorm ideas and suggest improvements. Improvements are then evaluated, and recommendations are made for implementation. AI could assist in the brainstorming and evaluation, as this is usually the result of hidden factory and data analysis.

>3/ Equipment Maintenance: The three primary metrics that are used for equipment uptime are Overall Equipment Effectiveness [(OEE)](https://www.oee.com), Mean Time Between Failure [(MTBF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_between_failures), and Mean Time to Recovery [(MTTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_to_recovery). Companies rely on these metrics to get a sense of how well their equipment is holding up and how effectively they are using it. AI could provide better metrics on equipment use by considering a more comprehensive range of inputs and make recommendations on how to adjust the usage to optimize production and lifespan. Like Quality, equipment maintenance heavily depends on updated documentation and training manuals, AI can help there as well.

## Results
Kinaxis is a company that has seen tremendous growth over the past 10 years. In [2013 revenues were $61M](https://stockanalysis.com/quote/tsx/KXS/revenue/) and are on track to cross $500M in 2024. This is a result of the popularity and industry leadership position of RapidResponse. The Kinaxis site has a over [100 case studies](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/customers) where they illustrate the successful use of their product. One of the constant themes is the ability to do [analysis](https://www.kinaxis.com/en/resources/content/c/teradyne-improving-i?x=R7Wat6&utm_source=website&utm_medium=osr&_gl=1*invned*_ga*MTIyNzY2NjE5OC4xNzEyMDgwMDUx*_ga_0VRJH9V89N*MTcxMjI2NjM2NS41LjEuMTcxMjI3MDI0NC41OC4wLjA.) with ML across functions, departments and even customers and vendors to drive decision making.

## Recommendation
I think that Kinaxis is in a good position to enhance its product offerings by incorporating AI functionality. Although they mention the use of AI in [manufacturing's production and design segment](https://www.kinaxis.com/en), I couldn't find any specific examples of this feature. Kinaxis products currently focus on the peripheral aspects of the supply chain like Planning, Returns, and Delivery Logistics and not on production. Therefore, there is an opportunity for them to integrate technologies such as sensors, cameras, and text scanning technologies to provide a solution that works at the operator level.
